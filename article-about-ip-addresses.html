		<h1>IPv4 and IPv6 Networking</h1>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>The Internet Protocol (IP) is the primary communication protocol used for sending and receiving data packets
			over the internet. IP addresses are used to identify devices connected to the internet, and there are two
			types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. In this article, we will provide an overview of IPv4 and IPv6
			addresses, explain the differences between the two, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
		<ul>
			<h3>IPv4 Addresses</h3>
			<li>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the most widely used IP addressing scheme.</li>
			<li>It uses a 32-bit address space, which means that there are approximately 4.3 billion unique IPv4
				addresses available.</li>
			<li>Each IPv4 address is represented in decimal notation with four decimal numbers separated by dots,
				<code>for example, 192.168.1.1</code>.</li>
			<li>IPv4 addresses are divided into two parts: network and host.</li>
			<li>The network part identifies the network to which the device belongs, while the host part identifies the
				device on the network.</li>
			<li>The subnet mask is used to divide the IP address into the network and host parts.</li>
			<li>For example, <code>a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0</code> means that the first three decimal numbers
				represent the network part, and the last decimal number represents the host part.</li>
			<li>IPv4 addresses are hierarchical and organized into classes.</li>
			<li>There are five classes of IPv4 addresses, which are identified by the first decimal number.</li>
			<li>Class A addresses start with 1 to 126, class B addresses start with 128 to 191, class C addresses start
				with 192 to 223, class D addresses start with 224 to 239, and class E addresses start with 240 to 255.
			</li>
			<h3>IPv6 Addresses</h3>
			<li>IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the successor to IPv4 and is designed to solve the problem of IPv4
				address exhaustion.</li>
			<li>IPv6 uses a 128-bit address space, which means that there are approximately 3.4Ã—10^38 unique IPv6
				addresses available.</li>
			<li>Each IPv6 address is represented in hexadecimal notation with eight groups of four hexadecimal digits
				separated by colons, <code>For example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.</code></li>
			<li>IPv6 addresses are divided into two parts: network and interface.</li>
			<li>The network part identifies the network to which the device belongs, while the interface part identifies
				the device on the network.</li>
			<li>The subnet mask is not used in IPv6, as the address is self-identifying.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of IPv4 and IPv6</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>IPv4 is the most widely used IP addressing scheme and is still used by many devices today.</li>
			<li>However, it has limitations due to the limited address space, which has led to address exhaustion.</li>
			<li>IPv6 was designed to solve this problem and has a much larger address space, which means that there will
				be enough addresses for all devices for the foreseeable future.</li>
			<br>
			<li>IPv6 also offers other advantages over IPv4, including improved security, auto-configuration, and better
				support for mobile devices.</li>
			<li>However, IPv6 adoption has been slow due to the need for infrastructure changes and the need for devices
				to support IPv6.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Difference between MAC, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses</h2>
		<p>MAC addresses, IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses are all different types of addresses used in computer
			networking. Here are some key differences between these address types:</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Name</th>
					<th>Format</th>
					<th>Scope</th>
					<th>Uniqueness</th>
					<th>Compatibility</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>MAC:</strong></td>
					<td>MAC addresses are 48-bit addresses represented in hexadecimal format.</td>
					<td>MAC addresses are used to identify devices on a local network, such as a LAN.</td>
					<td>MAC addresses are unique to each network interface controller (NIC) and are assigned by the
						manufacturer.</td>
					<td>MAC addresses are not routable and cannot be used to communicate outside of the local network.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>IPv4:</strong></td>
					<td>While IPv4 addresses are 32-bit addresses represented in decimal format.</td>
					<td>IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are used to identify devices on the Internet, as well as on local
						networks.</td>
					<td>IPv4 addresses are assigned by Internet service providers (ISPs) or network administrators, and
						there is a limited number of unique IPv4 addresses available.</td>
					<td>IPv4 addresses are routable and can be used to communicate across the Internet, but they are
						limited in number and are being phased out in favor of IPv6 addresses.</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td><strong>IPv6</strong></td>
					<td>IPv6 addresses, on the other hand, are 128-bit addresses represented in hexadecimal format.
					<td>
					<td>IPv6 addresses are also assigned by ISPs or network administrators, but there is a much larger
						pool of unique IPv6 addresses available.</td>
					<td>IPv6 addresses are the future of Internet addressing and are designed to replace IPv4 addresses,
						but there are still some compatibility issues that need to be addressed.</td>
				</tr>
